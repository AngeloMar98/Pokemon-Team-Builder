This is a Pokèmon Team Builder, you can search up any pokèmon and build your own team with its own moveset, see your team statistics and save that team configuration.
Everything is made using pure Javascript(and Typescript), and Tailwind, to fetch the pokèmon info I used the [PokèAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)

## The app features are:
- Flexible layout, adapting seamlessly from mobile to desktop;
- Searching any pokèmon by generation, type and name. All forms with relevant stat changes are included, it's up to date with first DLC of Pokémon Scarlet, The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero;
- Picking any of the search result displayed in a grid with its own sprite;
- Customize your pokèmon by picking moves and ability. For the two special cases, Arceus and Silvally you can pick the type too of course;
- See your team offensive and defensive coverage statistics in a side menu (for the offensive stats only STAB are counted);
- Store any of your teams in the local storage;
